        Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos involves multiple steps, such as, detec-
        tion of large numbers of objects, identifying inter-object occlusions, devising data
        association methods and finally, finding efficient and fast algorithms to determine
        object trajectories. This dissertation deals with the detection and tracking of
        multiple objects (e.g.,pedestrians), using a track-by-detection approach. For the
        detection part, we perform transfer learning on a single shot detector (SSD), a
        deep network based object detector which can detect the objects in a single for-
        ward pass of the network. The detector feeds to a data association system, which
        associates detections frame-by-frame based on appearance and location based fea-
        tures. We model the problem of finding optimal trajectories as a min cost flow
        problem. Mutual object occlusion is explicitly added in the constraint set along
        with other flow related constraints. We then derive a Langrangian relaxation of
        the problem, which is a much more generalised form of the relaxation formulation
        available in the literature. Based on this relaxation formulation, we develop the
        algorithm that can find the optimal trajectories or shortest paths in pseudo-polynomial time. 
        Our tracker performs quite close to the state-of-the-art, in terms of many standard
        MOT evaluation metrics.</section>

        In this thesis, we have outlined a tracking methodology that has the potential
        of tracking objects even in the middle of occlusion. Toward this end we have
        proposed an end-to-end system of modern, heavy duty tracking system comprising
        two important computer vision components. One is a robust detector that can
        handle various appearance variation related to pedestrians’ movement, and the
        second is a tracker that can solve the data association problem even when the
        people are occluded for a reasonable amount of time. We have used a state-of-
        the-art convolution neural net based single-shot detector to produce high quality
        detections in the video. In the tracking stage, we studied a recently proposed
        batch tracking method &mdash; based on the min-cost flow for graph optimization &mdash; and
        proposed a novel Lagrangian relaxation to further improve it.
        
        We have built a fairly large dataset (<b>Figure 1</b>) consisting of multiple videos which are 
        widely used by the computer vision for various benchmarking purposes. An exten-
        sive evaluation process is carried out to investigate how well the proposed tracker
        performs in comparison with the existing state-of-best of the art. Lastly, we have
        illustrated exciting future directions that this thesis can inspire to investigate.
